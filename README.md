# 🏦 Loan Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Loan Prediction Project**! This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to get approved for a loan based on various financial and personal details. The model is built using machine learning techniques, and the app interface allows users to input their details and get a prediction.

## 🌟 Overview

The project uses a machine learning model to predict loan approval. The application interface, built using Streamlit, makes it easy for users to interact with the model and get real-time predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Loan Approval Prediction**: Predict whether a loan will be approved based on input features.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface using Streamlit.
- **Model Comparison**: Various machine learning algorithms implemented and compared.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
